Rick The Chick 
by Cristian Cantoral


The code implemented uses Phaser 2.8v and it's included in the file.
The structure of the game is simple and it has in line comments that 
can help you with your game using Phaser. 

The structure of this game was created to have different behaviour in
each level. Simply copy the prototype in level 1, create a Javascript file 
and call it "level x"/whatever you'd like, and lastly paste it. After this, 
in the last level go to the nextlevel function and as a second argument 
write/type your level name. 

Then, you can add whatever you'd like to that specific level and it will 
not affect anything else.
